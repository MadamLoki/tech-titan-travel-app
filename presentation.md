## Intro

- Ade, Will & Sara
- Honorable Mention to Marvin

### What the App is & What did it solve

JourneySync is a Travel Planning/Companion app designed to assist travelers in planning trips & budgeting.

- The problem JourneySync was designed to solve, was the issue that there was not just _one_ place for people to plan, collaborate and establish travel plans.

#### How does it solve this?

- Budget Management
  - Creation of a budget to track, add, and categorize expenses
  - View a summary and breakdown of the expenses and where you are spending it!
  - Adjust the budget as needed
- Basic Itinerary creation & tracking times planned to visit, linked pages for viewing/research
  - Decide and selecting attractions for the city you visit
  - Time and Date planning
- User Profiles to save and store data
  - Travel checklist so you dont forget what you've packed or need to pack

#### Project Management

- Team met nightly/weekly and was able to manage time efficently
- Used Github issues board to list specific goals and what took priority
- Established what we wanted to complete, and what we felt was outside of the current scope
-

#### DEMO Time

Successes really boiled down to choosing tasks.
(list tasks, who did what, how they contributed and what was neat/cool that they did)

#### Future Features/Wishlists to add

- Allowing multiple users to access a calendar/budget itinerary
- allowing a "voting" feature for those "invited" to vote to decide on a event/resturant or various outings
- resturant list/reservation
- Travel blog/profile addons
- countdown timer to stored "travel date"
- Collaborative planning panel
- Ability to add in a interactive bar to search flights/rideshare/etc

#### What are we proud of?

Ade - Interactive Itinerary selection and dynamic local save
Will - Interactive landing page to "Get started" as well as the "Travel Budget" table and interactivity
Sara - Bootstrap CSS Framework, Profile Page, Travel Checklist and incorporating the Unsplash API search, making the project whole work and look good cohesively
Honorable Mention - Marvin - set up the travel checklist and Weather API
